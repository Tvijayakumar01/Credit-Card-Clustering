# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting credit card customers using clustering techniques. The objective is to identify distinct customer groups based on their spending behavior and other attributes, enabling businesses to design targeted marketing strategies and optimize customer retention.

## Problem Statement
Customer segmentation is critical for understanding diverse customer needs and improving service offerings. This project applies clustering algorithms to categorize credit card customers into groups based on transactional and demographic data.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and relationships in customer attributes.
- **Clustering Models**: K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN are employed to identify customer groups.
- **Evaluation**: Cluster validation using metrics such as silhouette scores and elbow method.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, and SciPy.

## Dataset
The dataset includes attributes like:
- Customer ID
- Annual Spending
- Transaction Frequency
- Credit Card Limit
- Other demographic and transactional details.

_Note: Dataset is anonymized to ensure privacy._

## Results
- Optimal clusters determined using the elbow method.
- Customer segments visualized through 2D PCA plots.
- Recommendations provided for marketing and customer engagement strategies.
