# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

## 📖 Overview
Have you ever wondered how companies tailor their marketing strategies to different groups of customers? This project addresses that by using **customer segmentation**—a method that groups customers based on their behavior and preferences. The goal is to help businesses understand their customers better, personalize services, and improve customer satisfaction.

In this project, we used **data clustering**, a popular technique in data science, to analyze credit card customer data and create meaningful groups. By doing this, businesses can:
- Identify high-value customers.
- Design targeted promotions.
- Reduce customer churn.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Businesses deal with large and diverse groups of customers, each with unique spending habits and preferences. Treating all customers the same can lead to inefficient marketing and lost revenue. 

Our project aims to:
- Group customers into **clusters** based on their spending patterns and demographic information.
- Provide actionable insights for marketing and customer retention strategies.

### Example Question:
Which group of customers spends the most? Which group is most likely to switch to a competitor?

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset includes the following columns:
1. **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
2. **Annual Spending**: Total amount spent by a customer in a year.
3. **Transaction Frequency**: Number of purchases made in a year.
4. **Credit Card Limit**: Maximum spending limit of the credit card.
5. Other attributes related to customer demographics and behavior.

**Note**: The dataset is anonymized to ensure privacy.

## 🧪 Methodology
Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removed any missing or duplicate data to ensure accuracy.
   - Scaled numerical features so they have equal importance during analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Created graphs and charts to understand customer behaviors.
   - Example: Bar charts showing spending patterns across age groups.

3. **Clustering Algorithms**:
   - Used **K-means Clustering** to divide customers into groups.
   - Evaluated the quality of clusters using methods like the **silhouette score**.

4. **Results and Insights**:
   - Identified groups such as high spenders, low-frequency buyers, and budget-conscious customers.

## 📈 Results
- **Clusters Identified**:
  - Example:
    - **Cluster 1**: High spenders who shop frequently.
    - **Cluster 2**: Customers with moderate spending and infrequent purchases.
    - **Cluster 3**: Budget-conscious customers with low annual spending.
- **Key Metrics**:
  - **Silhouette Score**: 0.72 (indicating good clustering quality).
  - **Elbow Method**: Helped determine the optimal number of clusters.

---

## 🏢 Business Applications
- **Targeted Marketing**: Focus high-value offers on Cluster 1 (high spenders).
- **Loyalty Programs**: Retain Cluster 2 (moderate spenders) by introducing loyalty rewards.
- **Cost Efficiency**: Avoid overspending on promotions for Cluster 3 (low spenders).
